    <h1>My Favorite Film Director</h1>

    <p>I love film and watching movies. Some big role models/people that inspire me are film directors. In particular, I am a big fan of <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong> films. His films combine both blockbuster with art to make an amazing cinematic experience. My favorite film is Memento.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan_filmography"> Click this to learn more about Nolan's filmography</a>.</p>
